Click Speed Tester (CPS)

Click Speed Tester is a browser-based tool designed to measure and visualize your clicking speed. It allows users to track clicks per second (CPS), see live performance charts, and maintain session history—all in a safe, interactive environment using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project is aimed at anyone curious about improving their clicking speed, testing reflexes, or learning interactive web development concepts.

📌 What This Project Is About?

Click Speed Tester demonstrates:

Accurate CPS measurement starting on the first click

Real-time tracking of total clicks and elapsed time

Average CPS calculation

Best CPS storage across sessions

Session history for the last 5 runs( a bit buggy )

Interactive bar chart showing clicks per 10-second interval

Keyboard support (Space key)

Responsive design for desktop and mobile

The goal is to provide a fun, interactive, and educational tool to understand speed, timing, and basic JavaScript functionality while interacting with a clean and responsive web interface.
